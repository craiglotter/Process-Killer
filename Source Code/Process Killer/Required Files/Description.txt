Process Killer

Process Killer allows you to stop processes by specifying process names in the program dialog. You can specify multiple processes to stop by using the ';;' delimiting character. You can also specify non-specific process name matching by using the * character as a wildcard character, either at a single end of the processname or at both ends for a more flexible search.
